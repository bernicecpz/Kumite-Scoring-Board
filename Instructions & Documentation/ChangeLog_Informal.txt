	Timer can switch between boolean values accurately, but not returning the correct time frequently
	The timing when starting has high frequency of skipping a few seconds
	The timer can be paused correctly and accurately once. However, subsequently it cannot be paused.

	Should consider writing my own. As of now everything seems to be correct. However,I am not sure how to make it work (Especially for the start and pause)
